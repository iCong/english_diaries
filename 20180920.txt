Today is Thursday. The National Day will come a few days later.
Work is a necessary procedure, but boredom comes with that. The feeling is meaningless, because I think my work is not worth anything. A few mouths ago, I read a interesting article, which talk about one serious and absurd statement: 
The works of most people are bullshit.
Most people's works are meaningless, remove some thing to another place, do not create anything new or fantastic. 
So what should I do? 
I must think, read and write. These things can tell me what is true feeling about being a human being.
In the next days, about 2 weeks, I have to write article like this day by day.
By this method I think I can improve my English skill.
This is how I just thought today.
